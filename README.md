# NBA Postion Classification

## Oveview
The NBA has grown exponentially in the last 10 years. Both in popularity and in how the game is generally been played. A player that is  taller usually plays closer to the basket, but as the game has evolved, those same type of players aren’t playing the traditional position. The NBA has 5 standard positions. Point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Those positions do not reflect the current state of the game. I want to reclassify these positions into more detailed and descriptive roles. An example of someone being labeled as a position but plays something entirely different would be LeBron James. He runs the point or plays a wing position, but is labeled as a Small Forward. These types of players are becoming more and more prevalent in today’s game, and I aim to reclassify the postions into roles that a player plays on a team.
