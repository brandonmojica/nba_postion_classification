## What are you trying to do?
 
The NBA has grown exponentially in the last 10 years. Both in popularity and in how the game is generally been played. A player that is usually taller and bigger plays closer to the basket, but as the game has evolved, those same type of players aren’t playing that position, but are being labeled as such. The NBA has 5 standard positions. Point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Those positions do not reflect the current state of the game. I want to reclassify these positions into something more detailed and descriptive. An example of someone being labeled as a position but plays something entirely different would be LeBron James. He runs the point or plays a wing position, but is labeled as a Power Forward. These types of players are becoming more and more prevalent in today’s game.
 
## How has this problem been solved before?

There have been a few scholarly and medium articles about this topic they are referenced below. Many methods have been used before. Some in python and some in R. The NBA classification has been done before, but I am going to incorporate NCAA basketball data to try and match players there with the same type of players in the NBA. Comparing certain player types to their counterpart in the NBA.
 
 
 
## What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
 
Comparing the player groups from the NBA to that of the NCAA and then trying to see which player would fit in that system. I think it could be something that teams could use as an early pass at players that fit in their system. I would need to group the players by teams after they are evaluated based on their position and style. 
 
 
 
## Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?

 
NBA teams could use this as a first pass to see which players coming out of the draft or the NCAA fit their system. A generalized idea at first, so that the fine details can then be combed through later. 
 
## How will you present your work?
 
I want to create a web application where you can select a player that is coming out of college or another type of program and see where that person would fit in best. If time is handled properly, I think this is definitely feasible.  


## What are potential problems with your capstone?

Scraping and handling this data will be difficult. There are a bunch of different stats that need to be parsed. Getting an early start is vital. 
 
## What is the next thing you need to work on? 

Starting the scripts to get the data is the immediate task. Getting a first model using k means or KNN to get a base model up. There are a bunch of different methods I’d like to use, but this would be a great start to understanding the data.
